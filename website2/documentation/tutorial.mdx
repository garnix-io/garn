# Tutorial

To install <Text type="proper">Garn</Text>, head over to our [getting started guide](/docs/getting_started).

## Your first `garn.ts` config

All examples in this tutorial are also available
[here](https://github.com/garnix-io/garn/tree/main/examples/getting-started).

<Text type="proper">Garn</Text> projects are configured with a single `garn.ts` file. (This file is read by <Text type="proper">Garn</Text> rather than run directly via `node` or `deno`.) Your `garn.ts`
exports a collection of `Project`s. A `Project` contains all the information
needed to build, run, and develop your software.

The <Text type="proper">Garn</Text> library exports a lot of helpers that make it easy to quickly
construct projects for common stacks, but you can also define these yourself.

Here is an example `garn.ts` file for a single node-based project:

```typescript
import * as garn from "https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.19/mod.ts";
import * as pkgs from "https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.19/nixpkgs.ts";

export const frontend = garn.javascript.mkNpmProject({
  description: "my frontend",
  nodeVersion: "18",
  src: "./frontend",
});
```

In the same directory you can now run `garn enter frontend` to enter a shell
with `node` version 18 available.

```bash
> garn enter frontend
[garn] Entering frontend shell. Type 'exit' to exit.
[...]
> node --version
v18.17.1
```

Hint: You may have noticed that running `garn enter frontend` generated two files, `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`. These should be committed to your repository rather than gitignored. They both ensure reproducibility, and allow Nix to be used directly rather than only via <Text type="proper">Garn</Text>.

`Projects` can contain `Check`s, which can be used to run automated tests for
your project. You can add them with `addCheck`.

```typescript
export const frontend = garn.javascript
  .mkNpmProject({
    description: "my frontend",
    nodeVersion: "18",
    src: "./frontend",
  })
  .addCheck("test", "npm test");
```

Now running `garn check frontend` will run `npm test` in the frontend project
environment. These `Check`s are pure, i.e. they are run in a build sandbox. The
downside of sandboxing is that these checks won't have access to the internet.
The upside is that they'll be (almost) perfectly reproducible, cacheable, and
runnable on CI (like <a href="https://garnix.io"><Text type="proper">Garnix</Text></a>, see [the
docs](https://garnix.io/docs) for more info).

## Multi-language support

You can configure multiple sub-projects with different tech stacks in a single
`garn.ts` file. Let's try to add a Go backend:

```typescript
export const backend = garn.go.mkGoProject({
  description: "my backend",
  src: "./backend",
  goVersion: "1.21",
});
```

This means that you can use <Text type="proper">Garn</Text> to configure bigger multi-language projects.
This enables anyone to run, test, and develop any part of your codebase,
without having to install any language-specific tools or learn how to use them.

<Text type="proper">Garn</Text> currently supports **Go**, **Npm** and **Haskell**. If you'd like to see
support for other languages or toolchains please [let us
know](https://github.com/garnix-io/garn/issues).
