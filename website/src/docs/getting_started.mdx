# Getting Started

## Installation

Please check out our [installation instructions](/docs/installing).

## Your first `garn.ts` config

All examples in this getting started guide are also available
[here](https://github.com/garnix-io/garn/tree/main/examples/getting-started).

`garn` projects are configured with a single `garn.ts` file. Your `garn.ts`
exports a collection of `Project`s. A `Project` contains all the information
needed to build, run, and develop your software.

The `garn` library exports a lot of helpers that make it easy to quickly
construct projects for common stacks, but you can also define these yourself.

Here is an example `garn.ts` file for a single node-based project:

```typescript
import * as garn from "https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.9/mod.ts";
import * as pkgs from "https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.9/nixpkgs.ts";

export const frontend = garn.javascript.mkNpmProject({
  description: "my frontend",
  nodeVersion: "18",
  src: "./frontend",
});
```

In the same directory you can now run `garn enter frontend` to enter a shell
with `node` version 18 available.

Note that -- if you do this in a git repo -- `garn` requires that your source
files must be tracked by git. You have to add them to your index, or at least
mark them as intended additions with `git add --intent-to-add`.

```bash
> git add --intent-to-add frontend
> garn enter frontend
[garn] Entering frontend shell. Type 'exit' to exit.
[...]
> node --version
v18.17.1
```

`Projects` can contain `Check`s, which can be used to run automated tests for
your project. You can add them with `addCheck`.

```typescript
export const frontend = garn.javascript
  .mkNpmProject({
    description: "my frontend",
    nodeVersion: "18",
    src: "./frontend",
  })
  .addCheck("test")`npm test`;
```

Now running `garn check frontend` will run `npm test` in the frontend project
environment. These `Check`s are pure, i.e. they are run in a build sandbox. The
downside of sandboxing is that these checks won't have access to the internet.
The upside is that they'll be (almost) perfectly reproducible.

## Multi-language support

You can configure multiple sub-projects with different tech stacks in a single
`garn.ts` file. Let's try to add a go backend:

```typescript
export const backend = garn.go.mkGoProject({
  description: "my backend",
  moduleName: "backend",
  src: "./backend",
  goVersion: "1.20",
});
```

This means that you can use `garn` to configure bigger multi-language projects.
This enables anyone to run, test, and develop any part of your codebase,
without having to install any language-specific tools or learn how to use them.

## Deno LSP

`garn.ts` files are powered by [deno](https://deno.com/).
A lot of the convenience and power for editing your `garn.ts` files comes
from having a working Deno LSP. Installing `deno` is easy with `garn` itself:

```typescript
export const deno = garn.mkProject(
  {
    description: "garn configuration environment",
    defaultEnvironment: garn.emptyEnvironment.withDevTools([pkgs.deno]),
  },
  {}
);
```

`garn enter deno` will then drop you in a shell where `deno` is available.

For configuring your editor to use Deno's LSP refer to [Deno's environment setup
documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment).

## CI

Since the checks of your `garn` projects are sandboxed, it's easy to run them on
[garnix.io CI](https://garnix.io). See [the docs](https://garnix.io/docs)
for more info.
