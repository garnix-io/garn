# Getting Started

## Installation


The easiest way to install <Garn/> is with the following command:

<BashSnippetToCopy snippet="sh <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://garn.io/install.sh)" />

<Garn/> works on the following platforms:

- Arm Linux
- Intel Linux
- Intel Macs<Hovernote>While the installer technically works for
  `x86_64-darwin`, the garnix binary cache currently doesn't build `garn` for
  that platform. That means that the installer has to compile `garn` and a
  whole lot of dependencies on your own machine. If you're interesting in
  better support for `x86_64-darwin`, please let us now on Github or
  Discord.</Hovernote>
- M1/M2 Macs

You can look at the contents of the script [here](https://garn.io/install.sh).

<Garn /> requires [Nix](https://nixos.org/). If you don't have Nix, the above
command will install it for you.

### Uninstalling

To uninstall both `nix` and `garn` you can run:

```bash
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
```

### Manual installation

If you prefer, you can also manually do the steps that the above script automates. Those are:

1. **Install Nix**. To install Nix, follow the instructions [here](https://nixos.org/download).
2. **Configure Nix to use the <Garnix/> cache**. You can do that by adding the lines:

```
extra-substituters = https://cache.garnix.io
extra-trusted-public-keys = cache.garnix.io:CTFPyKSLcx5RMJKfLo5EEPUObbA78b0YQ2DTCJXqr9g=
```

To `/etc/nix/nix.conf` (note that you'll need sudo).

3. **Restart the Nix daemon**. (Only necessary for multi-user installations, which are the default.) On Linux, that is:

```
sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon.service
```

And on Macs, it is:

```
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/org.nixos.nix-daemon
```

(You can run `nix-shell -p nix-info --run "nix-info -m"` to double-check whether you have a multi-user installation.)

4. **Install <Garn/>**. You can do that with:

```
nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' profile install -L github:garnix-io/garn
```

5. **Check that everything worked**. Run `garn --help` to confirm that <Garn/> is installed.

## Deno LSP

`garn.ts` files are powered by [deno](https://deno.com/). A lot of the
convenience and power for editing your `garn.ts` files comes from having a
working Deno LSP. There are two ways of setting up LSP for editing `garn.ts`
files: using <Garn/> itself to provide a properly-configured editor with
`editGarnConfig`, or setting up your editor yourself.

### `editGarnConfig`

<Garn /> offers an `Executable` called `editGarnConfig`. It will spin up a
vscodium editor that is pre-configured for editing `garn.ts` files. It won't use
or modify your local vscodium settings, if you have any. You can can add it to
your `garn.ts` file like this:

```typescript
export const edit = garn.editGarnConfig;
```

And then run it with `garn run edit`.

This is a very easy way to get up and running with editing `garn.ts` files. The
disadvantage is that the editor isn't your normal configured editor. So you
might consider installing the Deno LSP and configuring your editor:

### Installing the Deno LSP and configuring your editor

Alternatively you an install `deno` (including the Deno LSP) with <Garn/> itself:

```typescript
export const deno = garn.mkProject(
  {
    description: "garn configuration environment",
    defaultEnvironment: garn.emptyEnvironment.withDevTools([pkgs.deno]),
  },
  {}
);
```

`garn enter deno` will then drop you in a shell where `deno` is available.

For configuring your editor to use Deno's LSP refer to [Deno's environment setup
documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment).

## Shell autocompletions

<Garn /> ships with autocompletions for some popular shells. See below for
instructions on installing them:

### Bash

Add the following line to your `.bashrc`:

```
source <(garn --bash-completion-script `which garn`)
```

### Zsh

If you have `oh-my-zsh` installed, you likely already have a completion directory (`~/.cache/oh-my-zsh/completions` or `~/.oh-my-zsh/completions`). In that case, use:

```sh
garn --zsh-completion-script `which garn` > ~/.cache/oh-my-zsh/completions/_garn
```

Otherwise, check your `$fpath` variable to see if it already includes a directory for user-defined completions. If it does, use:

```sh
garn --zsh-completion-script `which garn` > $DIRECTORY_IN_YOUR_FPATH/_garn
```

If it does not, please refer to `zsh`s documentation about how to set up user-defined completions.


### Fish

Assuming `~/.config/fish/completions` exists and is in your `$fish_completion_path` (it should be), run:


```sh
garn --fish-completion-script `which garn` > ~/.config/fish/completions/garn.fish
```

## CI

Since the checks of your <Garn/> projects are sandboxed, it's easy to run them on
[garnix.io CI](https://garnix.io). See [the docs](https://garnix.io/docs)
for more info.
