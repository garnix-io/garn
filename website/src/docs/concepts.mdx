# Basic concepts

There are 4 concepts that are fundamental to `garn`:

- [`Environment`](#environments)
- [`Check`](#checks)
- [`Executable`](#executables)
- [`Package`](#packages)

There's another basic concept called `Project` that is used to bundle instances
of the above entities and give them structure. `Project`s are described at the
bottom in the [Projects](#projects) section.

All of these concepts are implemented as typescript types. Feel free to browse
the [API docs](https://doc.deno.land/https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.17/mod.ts) as well.

## Environments

(See also the [API docs](https://doc.deno.land/https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.17/mod.ts/~/Environment).)

`Environment`s define what is available to a computation. For example they can
contain compilers and developer tools that you want to use on a project, but
they may also define other things like environment variables that need to be
set.

Running `garn enter` in a shell will add whatever the `Enviroment` provides to
the shell environment that you're in. That means you can still use your local
developer tools, like your editor, etc., but will also have access to everything
provided by the `Environment` you entered.

The `garn` library provides a special environment called `emptyEnvironment`. As
you might have guessed it's an `Environment` that doesn't provide anything.

`Environment`s can also be used to create other things that then make use of
what the `Environment`s provide. For example `Check`s, which are our next topic.

## Checks

(See also the [API docs](https://doc.deno.land/https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.17/mod.ts/~/Check).)

`Check`s are commands (usually shell commands) that are used to define
reproducible, automated tests or other checks. They run in a sandbox, which
means they don't have access to your locally installed tools, nor to your local
file system. Instead they are always based on an underlying `Environment`, and
through that will have access to exactly the tools that the environment
provides. In addition, a _copy_ of your source files is provided in the sandbox.
That gives you the ability to define automated `Check`s on your source files.

You can run `Check`s with `garn check`.

Running `Check`s in a sandbox has its downsides, for example some tests require
internet access. The big advantage is that these `Check`s are almost perfectly
reproducible, since the sandbox they run in is very controlled. So a `Check`
that fails or passes on one machine will behave the same on any other machine.

This also means that running these checks on a CI system (for example
[garnix.io](https://garnix.io)) is very easy and requires no additional
configuration.

## Executables

(See also the [API docs](https://doc.deno.land/https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.17/mod.ts/~/Executable).)

`Executable`s are commands (usually shell snippets) that are being run on your
local machine (not in a sandbox). They are based on an underlying `Environment`,
and can make use of e.g. the tools that `Environment`s provide. You can use
`Executables` for a variety of purposes:

- Running your projects main executable during development,
- Running a code formatter,
- Running a code generator,
- Spinning up a database for development,
- etc.

Here's a small example:

```typescript
import * as garn from "https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.17/mod.ts";

export const hello =
  garn.emptyEnvironment.shell("echo Hello, world!");
```

You can run `Executable`s with `garn run`.

## Packages

(See also the [API docs](https://doc.deno.land/https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.17/mod.ts/~/Package).)

`Package`s are instructions to `garn` about how to _build_ a set of files. For
example for a Go backend a package would define how to compile it into
executables. For an Npm project it may define how the project can be bundled
into a set of files that can be served by a webserver.

The build scripts of `Package`s are being run in a sandbox (same as `Check`s).
That means they have access to a _copy_ of your source files, but not to the
internet or your local file system. This makes your builds almost perfectly
reproducible.

You can build `Package`s with `garn build`.

## Projects

(See also the [API docs](https://doc.deno.land/https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.17/mod.ts/~/Project).)

`Project`s are used to combine `Environment`s, `Check`s, `Executable`s and
`Package`s into a single entity. A `Project` can contain any number of these
entities. So for example it can contain multiple `Check`s, which you can all run
at once with `garn check <projectName>`. It can contain multiple `Packages` that
you can all build with `garn build <projectName>`.

`Project`s can have a default `Enviroment` (aptly called `defaultEnvironment`),
which allows you to call `garn enter` on a project. Similarly they can also have
a default `Executable` (called `defaultExecutable`), which allows you to call
`garn run` on a project.

Usually you create `Project`s through language specific helper functions, for
example `garn.javascript.mkNpmProject`. Here's an example of an Npm `Project`
that contains a few `Check`s and adds a developer tool to its default
environment:

```typescript
import * as garn from "https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.17/mod.ts";
import * as pkgs from "https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.17/nixpkgs.ts";

export const project = garn.javascript
  .mkNpmProject({
    src: ".",
    description: "An Npm frontend",
    nodeVersion: "18",
  })
  .addCheck("test", "npm run test")
  .addCheck("tsc", "npm run tsc")
  .withDevTools([pkgs.ripgrep])
  .addCheck("no todos allowed", "! rg --glob !node_modules -i todo .");

export const dev = project.shell("npm install ; npm run dev");
```

With this `garn.ts` file:

- `garn enter project` will enter a shell with `node`, `npm` and `ripgrep` installed.
- `garn check project` will
  - run the tests,
  - typecheck the project (with `tsc`).
  - search for `todo`s (with `ripgrep`) and fail if there are any.
- `garn run dev` will run the server locally in dev mode.
