# Basic concepts

There's 4 underlying entities that play a role in `garn`:

- `Environment`s
- `Check`s
- `Executable`s
- `Package`s

There's another basic concept called `Project` that is used to bundle instances
of the above entities and give them structure. `Project`s are described at the
bottom in the [Projects](#projects) section.

All of these concepts are implemented as typescript types. Feel free to browse
the [API documentation](todo).

## Environments

`Environment`s define what is available to a computation. For example they can
contain compilers and developer tools that you want to use on a project, but
they may also define other things like environment variables that need to be
set. You can enter an `Environment` with `garn enter`.

{/* TODO: maybe have an example of that? Or maybe that's too much duplication with the getting started guide? */}

Running `garn enter` in a shell will add whatever the `Enviroment` provides to
the shell environment that you're in. That means you can still use your local
developer tools, like your editor, etc., but will also have access to everything
provided by the `Environment` you entered.

The `garn` library provides a special environment called `emptyEnvironment`. As
you might have guessed it's an `Environment` that doesn't provide anything.

`Environment`s can also be used to create other things that then make use of
what the `Environment`s provide. For example `Check`s:

## Checks

`Check`s are commands (usually shell commands) that are used to define
reproducible automated tests or other checks. They run in a sandbox,
which means they don't have access to your locally installed tools, nor to your
local file system. Instead they are always based on an underlying `Environment`,
and through that will have access to the tools that the environment provides. In
addition, a _copy_ of your source files are
provided in the sandbox. That gives you the ability to define
automated `Check`s on your source files.

{/* TODO: maybe inline or link to a small example for a check? */}

You can run `Check`s with `garn check`.

Running `Check`s in a sandbox has its downsides, for example some tests require
internet access. The big advantage is that these `Check`s are almost perfectly
reproducible, since the sandbox they run in is very controlled. So a `Check`
that fails or passes on one machine will behave the same on any other machine.

This also means that running this checks on a CI system (for example
[garnix.io](https://garnix.io)) is very easy and requires no additional
configuration.

## Executables

`Executable`s are commands (usually shell snippets) that are being run on your
local machine (not in a sandbox). They are based on an underlying `Environment`,
and can make use of e.g. the executables that that `Environment` provides. You
can use `Executables` for a variety of purposes:

- Running your projects main executable during development,
- Running a code formatter,
- Run a code generator,
- Spin up a database for development,
- etc.

{/* TODO: Link to or inline a small example of this? */}

You can run `Executable`s with `garn run`.

## Packages

`Package`s are instructions to `garn` about how to _build_ a set of files. For
example for a go backend a package would define how to compile it into
executables. For an npm project it may define how the project can be bundled
into a set of files that can be served by a webserver.

The build scripts of `Package`s are being run in a sandbox (same as `Check`s).
That means they have access to a _copy_ of your source files, but not to the
internet or your local file system. This makes your builds almost perfectly
reproducible.

You can build `Package`s with `garn build`.

## Projects

`Project`s are used to combine `Environment`s, `Check`s, `Executable`s and
`Package`s into a single entity. A `Project` can contain any number of these
entities. So for example it can contain multiple `Check`s, which you can all run
at once with `garn check <projectName>`. It can contain multiple `Packages` that
you can all build with `garn build <projectName>`.

Here's an example of a `Project` that contains a few `Check`s and adds a
developer tool to its default environment:

```typescript
import * as garn from "https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.9/mod.ts";
import * as pkgs from "https://garn.io/ts/v0.0.9/nixpkgs.ts";

// - `garn enter frontend` will enter a shell with node, npm and ripgrep installed.
// - `garn check frontend` will
//   - run the tests,
//   - typecheck the project (with `tsc`).
//   - search for `TODO`s (with `ripgrep`) and fail if there are any.
export const project = garn.javascript
  .mkNpmProject({
    src: ".",
    description: "An NPM frontend",
    nodeVersion: "18",
  })
  .addCheck("test")`npm run test`
  .addCheck("tsc")`npm run tsc`
  .withDevTools([pkgs.ripgrep])
  .addCheck("no todos allowed")`! rg --glob !node_modules -i todo .`;

// - `garn run dev` will run the server locally in dev mode.
export const dev = project.shell`npm install ; npm run dev`;
```

`Project`s can have a default `Enviroment` (aptly called `defaultEnvironment`),
which allows you to call `garn enter` on a project. Similarly they can also have
a default `Executable` (called `defaultExecutable`), which allows you to call
`garn run` on a project.
